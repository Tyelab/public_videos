## POV_mouse_train.mp4 ##
This is a video from the point of view of the observer mouse. It shows the Social Railway trial structured paradigm, consisting of a switchable opaque barrier between observer and railcar that turns transparent as each new car is stopped in front of the observer and allows them to see the animal or object in the other car.  This video starts with a C57B6/J female mouse, followed by an aggressive male CD1, and ending with an empty railcar.
